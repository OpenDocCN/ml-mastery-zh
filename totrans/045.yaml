- en: In doing inferential statistics, you often want to test your assumptions. Indeed
    there is a way to quantitatively test an assumption that you thought of. Using
    the Ames Housing dataset, you’ll delve deep into the concept of hypothesis testing
    and explore if the presence of an air conditioner affects the sale price of a
    house.

- en: Inferential Statistics uses a sample of data to make inferences about the population
    from which it was drawn. Hypothesis testing, a fundamental component of inferential
    statistics, is crucial when making informed decisions about a population based
    on sample data, especially when studying the entire population is unfeasible.
    Hypothesis testing is a way to make a statement about the data.

    sell at a higher price than those without. To verify this claim, you’d gather
    data on house sales and analyze if there’s a significant difference in prices
    based on the presence of air conditioning. This process of testing claims or assumptions
    about a population using sample data is known as hypothesis testing. In essence,
    hypothesis testing allows us to make an informed decision (either rejecting or
    failing to reject a starting assumption) based on evidence from the sample and
    the likelihood that the observed effect occurred by chance.

    under $H_0$, that the difference in the price is by chance. This indicates that
    there’s a statistically significant difference in the average sale prices of houses
    with air conditioning compared to those without. This aligns with our visual observations
    from the histogram. Thus, the presence of an air conditioner does seem to have
    a significant effect on the sale price of houses in the Ames dataset.

    is the same. Switching from a two-sided to a one-sided t-test but arriving at
    the same conclusion implies that we had a clear expectation of the direction of
    the difference from the start, or the data strongly supported one direction of
    difference, making the outcome consistent across both test types.

    is fundamental to the design of statistical tests, influencing the test’s directionality
    (one-sided vs. two-sided), the interpretation of results (how we understand p-values
    and evidence), and decision-making processes (especially when the p-value is close
    to the significance level $\alpha$). This framework determines not only what we
    are testing for but also how we interpret and act on the statistical evidence
    obtained.

    Ames Housing dataset. You examined how the presence of an air conditioner might
    impact the sale price of a house. Through rigorous statistical testing, you found
    that houses with air conditioning tend to have a higher sale price than those
    without, a result that holds statistical significance. This not only underscores
    the importance of amenities like air conditioning in the real estate market but
    also showcases the power of hypothesis testing in making informed decisions based
    on data.
