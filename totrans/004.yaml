    leverage its natural language understanding capabilities, you should be careful
    not to allow it to hallucinate. Hallucination happens when you allow it to generate
    text out of context. This can be avoided when you explicitly mention using only
    the provided information for the task in the prompt, but nothing else.

    there be some information out of context, ChatGPT would not know. One particular
    example is domain-specific abbreviations and jargon. If there is information not
    very straightforward, ChatGPT may also fail to extract it. You may try to regenerate
    the second example above for a few times. ChatGPT sometimes cannot find the exact
    passenger volume since the text expressed it as a percentage of another volume.
