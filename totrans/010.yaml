    meaningful information from large amounts of data. It is not only time-saving
    but also facilitates quick decision-making. However, manual summarization techniques
    of hiring human experts to read, analyze and summarize the data have become obsolete
    due to the exponential growth of data. This is where the world felt the need to
    use Natural Language Processing techniques to develop an automated system that
    presents condensed information. ChatGPT is one of them and is widely used in various
    fields for summarization purposes.
