- en: The chi-squared test for independence is a statistical procedure employed to
    assess the relationship between two categorical variables—determining whether
    they are correlated or independent. The exploration of the visual appeal of a
    property and its impact on its valuation is intriguing. But how often do you associate
    the outlook of a house with functional features like a garage? With the chi-squared
    test, you can determine whether there exists a statistically significant correlation
    between features.

    relationships between **categorical variables**. It’s particularly valuable when
    working with nominal or ordinal data, where the variables are divided into categories
    or groups. The primary purpose of the Chi-squared test is to determine whether
    there is a statistically significant association between two categorical variables.
    In other words, it helps to answer questions such as:'

- en: The Chi-squared test works by comparing the observed frequencies of the categories
    in a contingency table to the expected frequencies that would be expected under
    the assumption of independence. The contingency table is a cross-tabulation of
    the two categorical variables, showing how many observations fall into each combination
    of categories.

    independence between the two variables, i.e., the observed frequencies (with or
    without garage) should match.'
  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Alternative Hypothesis ($H_1$):** The alternative hypothesis suggests that
    there is a significant association between the two variables, i.e., the observed
    frequencies (with or without garage) should differ based on the value of another
    variable (quality of a house).'

- en: The test statistic in the Chi-squared test is calculated by comparing the observed
    and expected frequencies in each cell of the contingency table. The larger the
    difference between observed and expected frequencies, the larger the Chi-squared
    statistic becomes. The Chi-squared test produces a p-value, which indicates the
    probability of observing the observed association (or a more extreme one) under
    the assumption of independence. If the p-value is below a chosen significance
    level $\alpha$ (commonly 0.05), the null hypothesis of independence is rejected,
    suggesting a significant association.

    The p-value is printed and found much less than $\alpha$. The extremely low p-value
    obtained from the test signifies a statistically significant association between
    a house’s external quality and the presence of a garage in this dataset.
