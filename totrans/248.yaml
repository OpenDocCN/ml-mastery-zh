    calculus, which concerns the mathematics of change and infinitesimals. It allows
    us to find the relationship between two changing variables and how these affect
    one another.

    is represented by the *slope* of the line, or its gradient. Since the line can
    be seen to *rise* 2 units for each single unit that it *runs* to the right, then
    its rate of change, or its slope, is equal to 2.

- en: For this particular example, the rate of change, represented by the slope, is
    positive since the direction of the line is increasing rightwards. However, the
    rate of change can also be negative if the direction of the line decreases, which
    means that the value of *y* would be decreasing as the value of *x* increases.
    Furthermore, when the value of *y* remains constant as *x* increases, we would
    say that we have *zero* rate of change. If, otherwise, the value of *x* remains
    constant as *y* increases, we would consider the range of change to be *infinite*,
    because the slope of a vertical line is considered undefined.

    hence a linear function, with an unchanging slope. Nonetheless, not all functions
    are this simple, and if they were, there would be no need for calculus.

    it into many infinitesimal straight pieces arranged alongside one another. If
    we had to consider one of such pieces at some particular point, *P*, on the curved
    shape of the parabola, we see that we find ourselves calculating again the rate
    of change as the slope of a straight line. It is important to keep in mind that
    the rate of change on a parabola depends on the particular point, *P*, that we
    happened to consider in the first place.

- en: We meet one such example when we come to train a neural network using the gradient
    descent algorithm. As the optimization algorithm, gradient descent iteratively
    descends an error function towards its global minimum, each time updating the
    neural network weights to model better the training data. The error function is,
    typically, non-linear and can contain many local minima and saddle points. In
    order to find its way downhill, the gradient descent algorithm computes the instantaneous
    slope at different points on the error function, until it reaches a point at which
    the error is lowest and the rate of change is zero.
