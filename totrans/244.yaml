- en: The concept of the limit of a function dates back to Greek scholars such as
    Eudoxus and Archimedes. While they never formally defined limits, many of their
    calculations were based upon this concept. Isaac Newton formally defined the notion
    of a limit and Cauchy refined this idea. Limits form the basis of calculus, which
    in turn defines the foundation of many machine learning algorithms. Hence, it
    is important to understand how limits of different types of functions are evaluated.

    see that for any polynomial, the limit of the polynomial when x approaches a point
    k is equal to the value of the polynomial at k. It can be written as:[![](../Images/401e4b84f1ba0db33552954c781549e5.png)](https://machinelearningmastery.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/poly.png)

    is evaluating the limit when x approaches a point and the function is defined
    at that point. The other case involves computing the limit when x approaches a
    point and the function is undefined at that point.

    1, and hence lim(x→0)h(x)=1.
