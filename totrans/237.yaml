- en: Many areas of calculus require an understanding of continuous functions. The
    characteristics of continuous functions, and the study of points of discontinuity
    are of great interest to the mathematical community. Because of their important
    properties, continuous functions have practical applications in machine learning
    algorithms and optimization methods.

    and two important theorems in the study of optimization algorithms, i.e., intermediate
    value theorem and extreme value theorem.

    your memory, you can take a look at [limits and continuity](https://machinelearningmastery.com/a-gentle-introduction-to-limits-and-continuity),
    where continuous functions are also briefly defined. In this tutorial we’ll go
    into more details.

    the boundary points) and parenthesis mean open intervals (do not include boundary
    points), for example,

    1, ceil(0.7) = 1, and so on. As a result, the function is continuous over the
    domain (0,1]. If we adjust the interval to (0,2], ceil(x) jumps to 2 as soon as
    x>1\. To plot ceil(x) for the domain (0,2], we must now lift our hand and start
    plotting again at x=2\. As a result, the ceil function isn’t a continuous function.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If the function is continuous over the entire domain of real numbers, then it
    is a continuous function as a whole, otherwise, it is not continuous as whole.
    For the later type of functions, we can check over which interval they are continuous.

    converse is not always true. A function may be continuous at a point a, but f'(a)
    may not exist. For example, in the above graph |x| is continuous everywhere. We
    can draw it without lifting our hand, however, at x=0 its derivative does not
    exist because of the sharp turn in the curve.

    We can see that the extreme value theorem guarantees that within an interval,
    there will always be a point where the function has a maximum value. The same
    can be said for a minimum value. Many optimization algorithms are derived from
    this fundamental property and can perform amazing tasks.
