    homeowners, investors, developers, municipal planners, and tech innovators, each
    bringing unique perspectives and objectives to the table. Within this intricate
    ecosystem, data emerges as the critical element that binds these diverse interests
    together, facilitating collaboration and innovation. PropTech, or Property Technology,
    illustrates this synergy by applying information technology to real estate, transforming
    how properties are researched, bought, sold, and managed through the power of
    data science.

    Feature engineering is the process of creating new variables or features from
    existing data that better represent the underlying problem. In your case, to enhance
    your understanding of real estate value. One such innovative feature is the **Price
    Per Square Foot (PSF)**. The PSF metric emerges as a critical tool in your analytical
    arsenal, offering a perspective on value beyond mere listing prices. By calculating
    the PSF for each property, you can compare properties more equitably, irrespective
    of their size or the absolute price. This measure illuminates the investment value
    per square foot of living space, providing a standardized scale for assessing
    the true worth of luxury properties.
