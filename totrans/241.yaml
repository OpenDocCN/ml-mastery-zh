- en: Let’s start by reviewing the slope of a line. In calculus the slope of a line
    defines its steepness as a number. This number is calculated by dividing the change
    in the vertical direction to the change in the horizontal direction when moving
    from one point on the line to another. The figure shows how the slope can be calculated
    from two distinct points A and B on a line.

    of a line is the same everywhere on the line; hence, any line can also be uniquely
    defined by the slope and one point on the line. From the known point we can move
    to any other point on the line according to the ratio defined by the slope of
    the line.

    the left graph of the figure below. If we want to measure the ‘steepness’ of this
    curve, it is going to vary at different points on the curve. The average rate
    of change when moving from point A to point B is negative as the value of the
    function is decreasing when x is increasing. It is the same when moving from point
    B to point A. Hence, we can define it over the interval [x0,x1] as:'

    move point B towards point A? Let’s call the new point B’. When the point B’ is
    infinitesimally close to A, the secant line would turn into a line that touches
    the curve only once. Here the x coordinate of B’ is (x0+h), with h an infinitesimally
    small value. The corresponding value of the y-coordinate of the point B’ is the
    value of this function at (x0+h), i.e., f(x0+h).
