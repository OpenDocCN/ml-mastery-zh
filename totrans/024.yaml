- en: Linear regression models are foundational in machine learning. Merely fitting
    a straight line and reading the coefficient tells a lot. But how do we extract
    and interpret the coefficients from these models to understand their impact on
    predicted outcomes? This post will demonstrate how one can interpret coefficients
    by exploring various scenarios. We’ll explore the analysis of a single numerical
    feature, examine the role of categorical variables, and unravel the complexities
    introduced when these features are combined. Through this exploration, we aim
    to equip you with the skills needed to leverage linear regression models effectively,
    enhancing your analytical capabilities across different data-driven domains.

- en: In this section, we focus on a single numerical feature from the Ames Housing
    dataset, “GrLivArea” (above-ground living area in square feet), to understand
    its direct impact on “SalePrice”. We employ K-Fold Cross-Validation to validate
    our model’s performance and extract the coefficient of “GrLivArea”. This coefficient
    estimates how much the house price is expected to increase for every additional
    square foot of living area under the assumption that all other factors remain
    constant. This is a fundamental aspect of linear regression analysis, ensuring
    that the effect of “GrLivArea” is isolated from other variables.

    score gives us a general idea of how well our model fits the data across different
    subsets, indicating the model’s consistency and reliability. Meanwhile, the mean
    coefficient quantifies the average effect of “GrLivArea” on “SalePrice” across
    all the validation folds.'

    per square foot. Specifically, it indicates that for each square foot increase
    in “GrLivArea,” the sale price of the house is expected to rise by approximately
    $110.52 (not to be confused with the price per square foot since the coefficient
    refers to the **marginal price**). Conversely, a decrease in living area by one
    square foot would typically lower the sale price by the same amount.

    model, categorical features require a different approach. Proper encoding of these
    categorical variables is crucial for accurate model training and ensuring the
    results are interpretable. In this section, we’ll explore One Hot Encoding—a technique
    that prepares categorical variables for linear regression by transforming them
    into a format that is interpretable within the model’s framework. We will specifically
    focus on how to interpret the coefficients that result from these transformations,
    including the strategic selection of a reference category to simplify these interpretations.

    a reference category that will make our model both interpretable and meaningful:'

- en: Having identified “MeadowV” as our reference neighborhood, we are now ready
    to apply One Hot Encoding to the “Neighborhood” feature, explicitly excluding
    “MeadowV” to establish it as our baseline in the model. This step ensures that
    all subsequent neighborhood coefficients are interpreted in relation to “MeadowV,”
    providing a clear comparative analysis of house pricing across different areas.
    The next block of code will demonstrate this encoding process, fit a linear regression
    model using K-Fold cross-validation, and calculate the average coefficients and
    Y-intercept. These calculations will help quantify the additional value or deficit
    associated with each neighborhood compared to our baseline, offering actionable
    insights for market evaluation.

    premium or deficit in house pricing. By setting “MeadowV” as the reference category
    in our One Hot Encoding process, its average sale price effectively becomes the
    intercept of our model. The coefficients calculated for other neighborhoods then
    measure the difference in expected sale prices relative to “MeadowV.” For instance,
    a positive coefficient for a neighborhood indicates that houses there are more
    expensive than those in “MeadowV” by the coefficient’s value, assuming all other
    factors are constant. This arrangement allows us to directly assess and compare
    the impact of different neighborhoods on the “SalePrice,” providing a clear and
    quantifiable understanding of each neighborhood’s relative market value.

- en: So far, we have examined how numerical and categorical features influence our
    predictions separately. However, real-world data often require more sophisticated
    models that can handle multiple types of data simultaneously to capture the complex
    relationships within the market. To achieve this, it is essential to become familiar
    with tools like the `ColumnTransformer`, which allows for the simultaneous processing
    of different data types, ensuring that each feature is optimally prepared for
    modeling. Let’s now demonstrate an example where we combine the living area (“GrLivArea”)
    with the neighborhood classification to see how these factors together affect
    our model performance.

    improved the R² score, rising to 0.7375 from the individual scores of 0.5127 and
    0.5408, respectively. This substantial increase illustrates that integrating multiple
    data types provides a more accurate reflection of the complex factors influencing
    real estate prices.

- en: However, this integration introduces new complexities into the model. The interaction
    effects between features like “GrLivArea” and “Neighborhood” can significantly
    alter the coefficients. For instance, the coefficient for “GrLivArea” decreased
    from 110.52 in the single-feature model to 78.93 in the combined model. This change
    illustrates how the value of living area is influenced by the characteristics
    of different neighborhoods. Incorporating multiple variables requires adjustments
    in the coefficients to account for overlapping variances between predictors, resulting
    in coefficients that often differ from those in single-feature models.

- en: The mean Y-intercept calculated for our combined model is $11,786\. This value
    represents the predicted sale price for a house in the “MeadowV” neighborhood
    with the base living area (as accounted for by “GrLivArea”) adjusted to zero.
    This intercept serves as a foundational price point, enhancing our interpretation
    of how different neighborhoods compare to “MeadowV” in terms of cost, once adjusted
    for the size of the living area. Each neighborhood’s coefficient, therefore, informs
    us about the additional cost or savings relative to our baseline, “MeadowV,” providing
    clear and actionable insights into the relative value of properties across different
    areas.
