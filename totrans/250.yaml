- en: If a typical calculus problem involves finding a value of a variable that optimizes
    a function, then calculus of variations is about funding a function that optimizes
    another function. We can see that this is relevant in machine learning and specifically
    neural networks as the neural network model (circuit) learns arbitrary functions
    under a loss function.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A common problem in conventional calculus is to find a value of x that maximizes
    (or minimizes) a function y(x). Similarly, in the calculus of variations we seek
    a function y(x) that maximizes (or minimizes) a functional F [y]. That is, of
    all possible functions y(x), we wish to find the particular function for which
    the functional F [y] is a maximum (or minimum).
