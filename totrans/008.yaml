- en: Machine Learning and Data Science are the two most essential technologies in
    Industry 4.0\. Data Science refers to extracting meaningful insights from data,
    while Machine Learning enables the computer to learn independently without being
    explicitly programmed. Mastering these fields requires a solid understanding of
    fundamental concepts, hands-on experience, and guidance from mentors. Traditional
    learning methods, like attending lectures, reading books, making notes, etc.,
    can be inflexible, expensive, and time-consuming. This is where ChatGPT can be
    your personalized tutor.

- en: Regularization is a technique that introduces a penalty term to the loss function
    during training. The penalty term is based on the complexity or magnitude of the
    model’s parameters. The purpose of this penalty term is to discourage the model
    from fitting the training data too closely, which can lead to overfitting.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    or idiosyncrasies of the training data, resulting in poor generalization to unseen
    data. Regularization helps to address this issue by adding a regularization term
    to the loss function, which controls the complexity of the model. The regularization
    term encourages the model to find a balance between fitting the training data
    well and keeping the model’s parameters small or constrained.

    deals with the relationship between the bias and variance of a model. Bias refers
    to the error introduced by approximating a real-world problem with a simplified
    model, making assumptions that may not hold. Variance, on the other hand, refers
    to the model’s sensitivity to fluctuations in the training data, meaning it captures
    noise or random variations rather than the true underlying patterns.
  prefs:

  prefs:
  - PREF_BQ
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The tradeoff arises when adjusting the complexity of a model. A model with high
    bias tends to be overly simplistic, making strong assumptions that may not match
    the underlying data distribution. Such a model may have low accuracy on both the
    training and testing data and is said to underfit the data. On the other hand,
    a model with high variance captures the noise or random fluctuations in the training
    data too closely. It may perform well on the training data but fails to generalize
    to unseen data, a phenomenon known as overfitting.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'Here’s how the tradeoff works: When you have a simple model with low complexity,
    such as linear regression with few features or low polynomial degree, it generally
    exhibits high bias and low variance. As you increase the complexity, say by adding
    more features or increasing the polynomial degree, the model becomes more flexible
    and can better fit the training data. However, this comes at the cost of potentially
    higher variance and lower bias. The model becomes more prone to overfitting and
    may fail to generalize well to unseen data.'
