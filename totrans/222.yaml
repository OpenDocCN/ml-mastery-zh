- en: When it comes to machine learning tasks such as classification or regression,
    approximation techniques play a key role in learning from the data. Many machine
    learning methods approximate a function or a mapping between the inputs and outputs
    via a learning algorithm.

- en: We come across approximation very often. For example, the irrational number
    π can be approximated by the number 3.14\. A more accurate value is 3.141593,
    which remains an approximation. You can similarly approximate the values of all
    irrational numbers like sqrt(3), sqrt(7), etc.

    its exact value. In this case approximation methods are used to find values, which
    are close to the function’s actual values.

- en: If the form of a function is known, then a well known method in calculus and
    mathematics is approximation via Taylor series. The Taylor series of a function
    is the sum of infinite terms, which are computed using function’s derivatives.
    The Taylor series expansion of a function is discussed in this [tutorial](https://machinelearningmastery.com/a-gentle-introduction-to-taylor-series).

- en: Another well known method for approximation in calculus and mathematics is [Newton’s
    method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_method). It can be used to approximate
    the roots of polynomials, hence making it a useful technique for approximating
    quantities such as the square root of different values or the reciprocal of different
    numbers, etc.

    function that holds the key to the relationship between the inputs and outputs.
    The form of this function is unknown. Here, we discuss several machine learning
    problems that employ approximation.

    inputs. In regression, the function that truly maps the input variables to outputs
    is not known. It is assumed that some linear or non-linear regression model can
    approximate the mapping of inputs to outputs.

    blood sugar. To describe the relationship between the calorie input and blood
    sugar output, we can assume a straight line relationship/mapping function. The
    straight line is therefore the approximation of the mapping of inputs to outputs.
    A learning method such as the method of least squares is used to find this line.

    is that of neural networks. It is assumed that the neural network as a whole can
    approximate a true function that maps the inputs to the class labels. Gradient
    descent or some other learning algorithm is then used to learn that function approximation
    by adjusting the weights of the neural network.

    2D space and the label of none of these points is given. A clustering algorithm
    generally assumes a model according to which a point can be assigned to a class
    or label. For example, k-means learns the labels of data by assuming that data
    clusters are circular, and hence, assigns the same label or class to points lying
    in the same circle or an n-sphere in case of multi-dimensional data. In the figure
    below we are approximating the relationship between points and their labels via
    circular functions.
