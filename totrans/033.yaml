    gender. Now, machine learning has changed this process. Machine learning algorithms
    can analyze large amounts of data. In this article, we will explore how machine
    learning improves customer segmentation.

    are based on similar traits or behaviors. The main goal is to understand each
    group better. This helps businesses create marketing strategies and products that
    fit each group’s specific needs.

- en: K-means clustering is an unsupervised algorithm. It operates without any predefined
    labels or training examples. This algorithm is used to group similar data points
    in a dataset. The goal is to divide the data into clusters. Each cluster contains
    similar data points. Let’s see how this algorithm works.

- en: One challenge in K-means clustering is to find out the optimal number of clusters.
    The elbow method help us in doing so. It plots the sum of squared distances from
    each point to its assigned cluster centroid (inertia) against K. T Look for the
    point where the inertia no longer decreases significantly with increasing K. This
    point is called the elbow of the clustering model. It suggests a suitable K value.

- en: At K=1, inertia is at the highest. From K=1 to K=5, the inertia decreases steeply.
    Between K=5 to K=7, the curve decreases gradually. Finally, at K=7, it becomes
    stable, so the optimal value of K is 7\.

    Furthermore, we showed how to implement the K-means algorithm to segment customers
    into different groups. First, we found a suitable number of clusters using the
    elbow method. Then, we implemented the K-means algorithm and visualized the results
    using a scatter plot. Through these steps, companies can segment customers into
    groups efficiently.
