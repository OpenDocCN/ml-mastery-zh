- en: In the realm of real estate, understanding the intricacies of property features
    and their impact on sale prices is paramount. In this exploration, we’ll dive
    deep into the Ames Housing dataset, shedding light on the relationships between
    various features and their correlation with the sale price. Harnessing the power
    of data visualization, we’ll unveil patterns, trends, and insights that can guide
    stakeholders from homeowners to real estate developers.

- en: Correlation is a statistical measure that illustrates the extent to which two
    variables change together. A positive correlation indicates that as one variable
    increases, the other also tends to increase, and vice versa. Conversely, a negative
    correlation implies that as one variable increases, the other tends to decrease.

    build a model to predict housing prices, these are the subset of input features
    with a high possibility of success. Correlated features may also caused by some
    other common factor, which itself is a topic in data science that you would like
    to investigate and elaborate on.

    SalesPrice, which by definition is 1.0\. From a feature selection perspective,
    you should also check `correlations[-10:]` for the most negatively correlated
    features, which may also be powerful in explaining the prices. This is not the
    case in this particular dataset.

    space, with colors indicating magnitudes or frequencies. In the context of correlations,
    a heatmap can beautifully illustrate the strength and direction of relationships
    between multiple features. Let’s dive into a heatmap showcasing the correlations
    among the top features most correlated with *SalePrice*.

    between multiple variables simultaneously. The color intensity in each cell of
    the heatmap corresponds to the magnitude of the correlation, with warmer colors
    representing positive correlations and cooler colors indicating negative correlations.
    There is no blue in the heatmap above because only the 10 most positively correlated
    columns are concerned.

    positive correlation with **SalePrice**, with a correlation coefficient of approximately
    0.79\. This implies that as the quality of the house increases, the sale price
    also tends to increase.'

    and total basement area respectively, also show strong positive correlations with
    the sale price.'

    that as these features increase or improve, the sale price of the house also tends
    to go up.

    **GarageCars** and **GarageArea** are strongly correlated, which makes sense as
    a larger garage can accommodate more cars.

    crucial to visualize these relationships further. Scatter plots, for instance,
    can paint a clearer picture of how two features interact with each other. Moreover,
    it’s essential to discern between correlation and causation. A high correlation
    does not necessarily imply that one variable causes changes in another. It merely
    indicates a relationship.

- en: 'The scatter plots emphasize the strong positive relationships between sale
    price and key features. As the overall quality, ground living area, basement area,
    and first floor area increase, houses generally fetch higher prices. However,
    some exceptions and outliers suggest that other factors also influence the final
    sale price. One particular example is from the “House Prices vs. Ground Living
    Area” scatter plot above: At 2500 sq. ft. and above, the dots are dispersed, suggesting
    that there is a wide range in the house price in which the area is not strongly
    correlated or not effectively explained.'
