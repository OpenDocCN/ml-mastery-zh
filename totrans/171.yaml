    You have a picture of the perfume bottle, as follows, and you want to create a
    poster for it. To make things simple, let’s assume this poster has no text, and
    you want to consider the graphics only.

    resize and rotate the product and put it on the canvas in the same way as you
    would like it to be in the final poster. An example is as follows:'

    In this case, you should export the image and do some editing. Remember the template
    image you created at the beginning? Because it is a white background, you can
    easily set the background transparent in Photoshop or GIMP. Make the newly generated
    picture as a background layer, the original template as the top layer, and remove
    the white background. This makes the correct product on the background, and it
    matches perfectly on the size and position because you used the Canny type ControlNet
    in generating the picture. You will see an effect like the following:'

    Stable Diffusion. You provide the image with no prompt, and set the denoising
    strength to low but not zero value, then you are asking Stable Diffusion to regenerate
    the same picture with some minor change. Usually, those are the touch-ups on the
    parts that look unnatural.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In this example, you upload the image at img2img tab, and set the resize mode
    to “Just resize” (so that aspect ratio is preserved). Then pick the “Resize by”
    tab and max out it to 4x scale. Most sampling methods work but you want more sampling
    steps (so each steps are small to avoid drastic change to the picture). You can
    lower the CFG scale a bit, but set “Denoising strength” to 0.33.

    the subject and one for the background. You can use Canny for the subject as above.
    But instead of writing a detailed prompt to create the background, you can provide
    a sample picture to the second unit of ControlNet and set the control type to
    IPAdapter. In this way, the sample picture’s color scheme and style will be adopted.
    You can use a simpler description of the background as the prompt. The diffusion
    process will know what to generate.'

    weight of all units because the total influence to the final output is the sum
    of all the weights.

    Diffusion to create the final output. You used txt2img to create a picture and
    img2img function to polish the output. You also used external picture editor to
    help creating images for use with ControlNet. Not a single tool to get all the
    job done, but you learned how to use Stable Diffusion as a building block for
    a larger project.
