    may be unaware of. To accelerate machine learning model training, most engineers
    currently utilize GPUs (Graphics Processing Units) or multiple GPUs. However,
    TPUs (Tensor Processing Units) can provide even faster training times. You may
    not be able to find many instructions to use TPUs, but you can ask ChatGPT for
    help by writing a correct prompt.

    code with placeholders. To properly execute the code, you must replace the placeholders
    with your dataset loading and preprocessing code, model architecture, loss function,
    evaluation metrics, optimizer, training parameters, training data, and test data.
