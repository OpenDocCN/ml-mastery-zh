- en: You’ve probably heard of Kaggle data science competitions, but did you know
    that Kaggle has many other features that can help you with your next machine learning
    project? For people looking for datasets for their next machine learning project,
    Kaggle allows you to access public datasets by others and share your own datasets.
    For those looking to build and train their own machine learning models, Kaggle
    also offers an in-browser notebook environment and some free GPU hours. You can
    also look at other people’s public notebooks as well!

    hosts, with some of them offering 5-figure prize pools and seeing hundreds of
    teams participating. Besides these competitions, Kaggle also allows users to publish
    and search for datasets, which they can use for their machine learning projects.
    To use these datasets, you can use Kaggle notebooks within your browser or Kaggle’s
    public API to download their datasets which you can then use for your machine
    learning projects.
