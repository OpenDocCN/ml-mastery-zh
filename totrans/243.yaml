    of change and is denoted by either f'(x) or df/dx. Let’s first look at its definition
    and a pictorial illustration of the derivative.

    interval between x and (x+Δx) smaller and smaller until it is infinitesimal. Hence,
    we have the limit (Δ????→0). The numerator f(x+Δx)-f(x) represents the corresponding
    change in the value of the function f over the interval Δx. This makes the derivative
    of a function f at a point x, the rate of change of f at that point.

    giant Newton used f'(x) to denote the derivative of a function. Leibniz, another
    mathematical hero, used df/dx. So df/dx is a single term, not to be confused with
    a fraction. It is read as the derivative of a function f with respect to x, and
    also indicates that x is the independent variable.

    Velocity is the rate of change of distance w.r.t. time. Hence if f(t) represents
    the distance travelled at time t, then f'(t) is the velocity at time t. The following
    sections show various examples of computing the derivative.

    In this section, we’ll see how the definition of the derivative can be used to
    find the derivative of different functions. Later on, once you are more comfortable
    with the definition, you can use the defined rules to differentiate a function.

    = -4
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: From the figure, we can see that the value of g(x) is very large for large negative
    values of x. When x < 0, increasing x decreases g(x) and hence g'(x) < 0 for x<0\.
    The graph flattens out for x=0, where the derivative or rate of change of g(x)
    becomes zero. When x>0, g(x) increases quadratically with the increase in x, and
    hence, the derivative is also positive.
