- en: Research has always been essential to human progress and has evolved tremendously
    over the past few years. With the advent of advanced technologies, new tools and
    techniques have emerged to conduct more efficient research and to stay at the
    forefront of knowledge. One such technology is ChatGPT, a large language model
    that uses deep learning approaches to generate human-like responses. The remarkable
    ability of ChatGPT to understand and develop text has made it an invaluable tool
    that can enhance your research. Your productivity as a researcher is improved
    as it saves time and resources by providing comprehensive insights. However, researchers
    must be careful about the ethical considerations of using ChatGPT and ensure that
    their research is accurate and unbiased.

    customer service. They collected this data from 50 customers using the Likert
    Scale Questionnaire with 10 questions. The data is numerical ratings from 1 to
    5, where 1 indicates “Very Dissatisfied” while 5 indicates “Very Satisfied”. Interpreting
    this raw data using conventional methods will be time-consuming and requires dedicated
    software expertise. This is where you can use ChatGPT to help you make sense of
    the data.
