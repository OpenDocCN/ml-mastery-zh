    the fundamentals, you will not only be able to grasp the more complex concepts
    but also find them fascinating. To understand machine learning algorithms, you
    need to understand concepts such as gradient of a function, Hessians of a matrix,
    and optimization, etc. The concept of limits and continuity serves as a foundation
    for all these topics.

    a limit formally, we’ll use the the notion of the Greek letter ????. The mathematics
    community agrees to use ???? for arbitrarily small positive numbers, which means
    we can make ???? as small as we like and it can be as close to zero as we like,
    provided ????>0 (so ???? cannot be zero).

    and |x-k| is the distance of x from k that ignores the sign of the difference.
    Similarly, |f(x)-L| is the distance of f(x) from L. Hence, the definition says
    that when the distance of x from k approaches an arbitrary small value, the distance
    of f(x) from L also approaches a very small value. The figure below is a good
    illustration of the above definition:'
